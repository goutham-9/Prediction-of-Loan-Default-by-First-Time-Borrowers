Collaborated on a Master's capstone project focusing on the prediction of loan defaults among first-time borrowers using exploratory data analysis and data mining techniques. The study addressed the challenges of evaluating financial risk without historical credit data, aiming to enhance decision-making processes in loan approvals and minimize financial risks. Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, reducing dimensions and handling missing values to improve dataset reliability for predictive modeling. Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to identify the most effective predictors of loan default. Analyzed and interpreted data to understand the impact of various factors such as credit-to-income ratio, employment history, and regional economic conditions on loan default probabilities. Developed a predictive model that successfully identified key risk factors associated with loan defaults, providing actionable insights for financial institutions to refine risk assessment and lending strategies. Enhanced the credit decision-making process by integrating data-driven insights, thereby reducing potential bad debts and facilitating access to credit for qualified applicants.
